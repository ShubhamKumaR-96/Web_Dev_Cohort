What is Node.js?
Node.js is not a programming language. Instead, it’s a runtime environment that allows JavaScript code to be run outside of a web browser. It uses the V8 engine (the same engine powering Google Chrome) to execute JavaScript efficiently on servers.

How Node.js Works:
Built on V8: The V8 engine is responsible for converting JavaScript code into machine code, allowing it to run directly on a computer's processor.
Event-Driven & Non-Blocking Architecture: Node.js uses an event loop to handle tasks asynchronously, meaning it can process multiple requests without waiting for each one to finish. This makes it ideal for high-concurrency applications like real-time chat apps or servers handling multiple requests.

Here’s a simple diagram showing how Node.js works compared to a traditional server:

TRADITIONAL SERVER (Blocking):
Client Request 1  --> Server --> Process Request --> Respond
Client Request 2  --> Server (Waits for previous request to finish) 

NODE.JS SERVER (Non-blocking):
Client Request 1  --> Server --> Process --> Respond
Client Request 2  --> (Server is already handling multiple requests without waiting)
Real-Life Example:
Think of Node.js like a restaurant kitchen. Traditional kitchens can handle only one order at a time (blocking), where each dish is prepared fully before starting the next. On the other hand, Node.js works like a fast-food kitchen: multiple orders are handled at the same time (non-blocking), so while one burger is grilling, another order’s fries are frying.

Why is Node.js Used?
High Concurrency: It can handle many users or tasks at the same time efficiently, thanks to its non-blocking nature.
Real-Time Applications: Perfect for apps like live chats, online games, and collaborative tools, where multiple people interact simultaneously.
Single Language for Full Stack: JavaScript can now be used for both the frontend and backend, simplifying the development process.
Bun: A Faster Alternative
Bun is a new JavaScript runtime, written in Zig, introduced to improve performance over Node.js. Some reasons why Bun is faster:

Efficient Build: Zig allows better memory and performance optimizations.
Speed Focus: It’s designed to start faster and run JavaScript code quicker than Node.js.
Bun aims to address some performance limitations of Node.js and cater to developers seeking more speed in their applications.

Summary:
Node.js: Environment that runs JavaScript on the server using the V8 engine.
Why Node.js: It’s efficient for real-time, high-concurrency applications.
Bun: A faster runtime for JavaScript that aims to overcome some of Node.js’s speed limitations.

What is HTTP?
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a set of rules that allows computers (like your web browser and a website's server) to communicate with each other. It is used specifically for websites and is the most common way for your browser (frontend) to talk to a web server (backend).

Real-Life Example:
Imagine sending a letter to your friend:

You write the letter (HTTP Request).
Your friend reads it and sends back a reply (HTTP Response).
Once the letter is delivered, you don’t keep the connection open (like a phone call), but rather, send and receive messages individually.
Key Features of HTTP:
Stateless:

Each request is separate, and the server doesn’t remember anything about the previous ones. Every time you send a new request (like clicking on a different link), it doesn’t "remember" the last one.
Connectionless:

Once a request is made, the connection between the browser and server closes after the server responds. There is no continuous connection like in a phone call.
Text-Based:

The messages sent back and forth are written in human-readable text. So, it's easy for people to understand what’s going on, like reading headers and the content.
Request-Response Model:

The communication follows a simple pattern: you (the client) send a request, and the server replies. You ask for something (like a web page), and the server sends back what you requested or tells you there was an error.

         |--- HTTP Request -->                  |
         |                                      | (Processes request, e.g., retrieves a web page)
         |                                      |
         |<--- HTTP Response ---                |
         |                                      |
What is an HTTP Server?
An HTTP server is any system or software (code) that follows the rules of HTTP. It listens for requests, processes them, and then sends back responses. It handles things like delivering web pages when a browser asks for them.

What are Protocols?
Protocols are sets of rules and standards that define how data is transmitted and communicated over a network. They ensure devices (like computers, phones, and servers) can talk to each other correctly, even if they were made by different manufacturers or run different software.

Real-Life Example of Protocols:
Imagine different people from around the world trying to play the same board game. If everyone follows the same rules (protocols), they can play together, even if they don’t speak the same language.

Types of Protocols:
HTTP: For transferring web pages between servers and browsers.
WebRTC: A protocol for enabling real-time communication (like video calls).
Why are Protocols Important?
Protocols allow different systems (like a web browser and a server) to understand and interpret the data being exchanged, regardless of how they were built. Without protocols, it would be difficult for devices or software made by different people to communicate effectively.

Summary of HTTP:
Purpose: To transfer data (like web pages) between servers and browsers.
Stateless: Each request is independent.
Connectionless: The connection closes after each request/response.
Text-based: Messages are written in readable text.
Request-Response Model: The browser asks, and the server replies.


Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS:
Feature	HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)	HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
Security	Not secure, data is sent in plain text. Anyone intercepting the connection can read the data.	Secure, data is encrypted, meaning that even if it's intercepted, it cannot be easily read.
Port	Uses Port 80 for communication.	Uses Port 443 for communication.
Encryption	No encryption, making it vulnerable to attacks like man-in-the-middle (MITM).	Uses SSL/TLS encryption, making data transfer secure.
Data Protection	No protection for sensitive data like passwords, credit card numbers, etc.	Protects sensitive data during transmission.
SEO	Search engines (like Google) do not favor HTTP websites.	Search engines prefer HTTPS websites and rank them higher.
URL	Starts with http://.	Starts with https://, where "S" stands for Secure.
Certificates	No security certificates are needed.	Requires an SSL/TLS certificate to ensure authenticity and encryption.
Use Case	Suitable for non-sensitive websites, like blogs or news.	Recommended for any site handling sensitive data, such as online shopping or login systems.

        HTTP                     HTTPS
Client --------- Plain Text --------> Server
Client --- Encrypted Data (Secure) --> Server
Key Differences:
Security: HTTPS encrypts data using SSL/TLS, while HTTP does not, making HTTPS more secure for sensitive transactions.
Trust: Websites with HTTPS are more trustworthy and are given higher priority by search engines.
Encryption: HTTPS ensures that data between your browser and the server is encrypted and cannot be easily intercepted or tampered with.
