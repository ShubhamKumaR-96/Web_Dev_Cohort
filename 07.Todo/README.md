# Some Interview question

# 1. Question: What is the purpose of useEffect in the TodosList component?
Answer: useEffect is a hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. In the TodosList component, useEffect is used to call the fetchTodos function when the component mounts. This ensures that the list of todos is fetched from the backend API as soon as the component is rendered for the first time.

# 2. Question: Explain how state management is handled in this component.
Answer: State management in the TodosList component is handled using the useState hook. There are several state variables:

todos: An array to store the list of todos fetched from the server.
newTitle and newDescription: Strings to hold the title and description of a new todo being added or edited.
editingTodo: An object to keep track of the todo item currently being edited. This helps populate the input fields when a user wants to edit a todo.

# 3. Question: How does the component handle adding a new todo?
Answer: To add a new todo, the addTodo function is called when the "Add Todo" button is clicked. This function makes a POST request to the server with the new title and description. Upon a successful response, the newly created todo is appended to the existing todos array using the setTodos function, and the input fields are cleared.

# 4. Question: Describe the process for updating an existing todo.
Answer: Updating an existing todo involves the updateTodo function. When a todo is selected for editing, its current values are set in the input fields. When the "Update Todo" button is clicked, a PUT request is made to the server with the updated title and description. Upon receiving a successful response, the todos array is updated with the new data, and the input fields are reset to their initial state.

# 5. Question: What are some advantages of using Axios for API calls in this component?
Answer: Using Axios offers several advantages:

Simplified Syntax: Axios has a more concise syntax compared to the native fetch API, making it easier to read and write.
Promise-Based: It supports Promises, allowing for cleaner async/await code.
Automatic JSON Transformation: Axios automatically transforms response data into JSON, which reduces the need for manual parsing.
Interceptors: It allows you to define interceptors for request and response, making it easier to handle authentication and error handling globally.
6. Question: How does the component handle deleting a todo item?
Answer: The deleteTodo function handles the deletion of a todo item. When the "Delete" button is clicked, this function makes a DELETE request to the server with the specified todo's ID. After a successful deletion, the local todos state is updated by filtering out the deleted todo from the array, ensuring the UI reflects the current state.

# 7. Question: What strategies are used to manage user input in the form fields?
Answer: User input is managed through controlled components. Each input field has a value attribute linked to its respective state variable (newTitle and newDescription). The onChange event handlers update the state variables as the user types, ensuring that the input values are always in sync with the component's state.

# 8. Question: Can you explain how you would implement error handling in the API requests?
Answer: Error handling can be implemented using try-catch blocks around the asynchronous API calls. For instance, in the addTodo, updateTodo, and deleteTodo functions, the requests can be wrapped in a try-catch statement to catch any errors during the request. Upon catching an error, you can log the error, display a user-friendly message, or update the UI to reflect the error state.

# 9. Question: What is the purpose of the editingTodo state, and how is it utilized?
Answer: The editingTodo state holds the todo item that is currently being edited. It is used to populate the input fields with the existing values of the selected todo when a user initiates editing. If editingTodo is not null, the button label changes to "Update Todo," indicating that the user is editing an existing item instead of adding a new one.

# 10. Question: How would you optimize the rendering of the todo list?
Answer: To optimize rendering, we can consider:

React.memo: Wrap the todo list items in React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders when the parent component updates but the individual todos have not changed.
Key Prop: Ensure that each todo item in the list has a unique key prop (which is already done in the code with todo._id).
Batch Updates: Group state updates in the addTodo, updateTodo, and deleteTodo functions to minimize re-renders.
